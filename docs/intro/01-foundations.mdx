# Foundations: Sensors, Actuators, and the Humanoid Landscape

## Introduction to Physical AI Foundations

Physical AI represents a convergence of several key technologies that enable machines to interact intelligently with the physical world. At its core, Physical AI involves:

- **Perception**: Gathering information from the environment using sensors
- **Cognition**: Processing sensory information to understand the world and make decisions
- **Action**: Executing physical tasks through actuators and control systems
- **Learning**: Adapting behavior based on experience and environmental feedback

This chapter establishes the foundational concepts you'll need to understand throughout your journey with humanoid robotics.

## Key Components of Physical AI Systems

### Sensors

Sensors form the foundation of a robot's perception system, providing essential data about the environment and internal state:

```python
# Example sensor data structure in ROS2
from std_msgs.msg import Float32MultiArray
from sensor_msgs.msg import LaserScan, Image, Imu

# Common sensor types in humanoid robotics:
# - LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)
# - RGB-D cameras
# - Inertial Measurement Units (IMU)
# - Force/Torque sensors
# - Joint encoders
# - Tactile sensors
```

#### Types of Sensors:
1. **Proprioceptive Sensors**: Measure internal state (joint angles, motor currents, IMU)
2. **Exteroceptive Sensors**: Measure external environment (cameras, range finders)
3. **Tactile Sensors**: Measure contact forces and surface properties

### Actuators

Actuators convert control signals into physical motion. In humanoid robots, these include:
- **Servo Motors**: For precise joint control
- **Hydraulic/Pneumatic Systems**: For high-force applications
- **Series Elastic Actuators**: For compliant control
- **Shape Memory Alloys**: For biomimetic actuators (emerging technology)

### Control Systems

Humanoid robots require sophisticated control systems to coordinate multiple degrees of freedom:

    B --> C[Inverse Kinematics]
    C --> D[Joint Level Controller]
    D --> E[Actuators]
    E --> F[Robot]
    F --> G[Sensors]
    G --> B
```

## The Humanoid Robotics Landscape

### Historical Context

## Sensor Technologies in Depth

### Vision Systems

Vision is crucial for humanoid robots operating in human environments:

```python
# ROS2 example: Processing RGB-D data
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from sensor_msgs.msg import Image, CameraInfo
from cv_bridge import CvBridge
import cv2
import numpy as np

class VisionProcessor(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('vision_processor')
        self.subscription = self.create_subscription(
            Image,
            '/camera/rgb/image_raw',
            self.image_callback,
            10)
        self.bridge = CvBridge()
        
    def image_callback(self, msg):
        cv_image = self.bridge.imgmsg_to_cv2(msg, "bgr8")
        # Process image for object detection, tracking, etc.
        processed_image = self.process_image(cv_image)
        
    def process_image(self, image):
        # Implement computer vision algorithms
        return image
```

Modern humanoid robots typically use:
- **RGB cameras** for color perception
- **Depth sensors** (LiDAR, stereo, ToF) for 3D perception
- **Thermal cameras** for environmental awareness
- **Event cameras** for high-speed motion detection

### Tactile Sensing

Tactile sensing is essential for safe and effective manipulation:

- **GelSight sensors**: High-resolution surface geometry
- **Force/Torque sensors**: Measurement of interaction forces
- **Tactile arrays**: Distributed pressure sensing
- **Temperature sensors**: Environmental and safety monitoring

## Actuator Technologies

### Servo Actuators

Most humanoid robots use servo actuators with position, velocity, or torque control:

```xml
<!-- URDF example: Joint definition -->
<joint name="hip_pitch_joint" type="revolute">
  <parent link="torso"/>
  <child link="thigh"/>
  <origin xyz="0 0 -0.1" rpy="0 0 0"/>
  <axis xyz="1 0 0"/>
  <limit lower="-1.57" upper="1.57" effort="100" velocity="5"/>
  <dynamics damping="1.0" friction="0.1"/>
</joint>
```

### Series Elastic Actuators (SEA)

SEAs provide compliant control crucial for safe human-robot interaction:

```
Motor -> Gearbox -> Spring -> Output
         ^                    ^
         |                    |
     Encoder            Output Encoder
```

Advantages of SEAs:
- Inherent safety through mechanical compliance
- Accurate force control
- Back-drivability
- Energy efficiency through spring energy storage

## Software Architecture

### Robot Operating System (ROS2)

ROS2 provides the middleware infrastructure for humanoid robotics:

```python
# Example ROS2 node for humanoid control
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from sensor_msgs.msg import JointState
from trajectory_msgs.msg import JointTrajectory

class HumanoidController(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('humanoid_controller')
        
        # Publishers and subscribers
        self.joint_pub = self.create_publisher(JointState, '/joint_states', 10)
        self.trajectory_sub = self.create_subscription(
            JointTrajectory, 
            '/joint_trajectory', 
            self.trajectory_callback, 
            10)
        
    def trajectory_callback(self, msg):
        # Process trajectory and generate control commands
        pass
```

### Control Architecture

Humanoid robots typically implement multiple control layers:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Task Planner] --> B[Motion Planner]
    B --> C[Whole-Body Controller]
    C --> D[Joint Controllers]
    D --> E[Actuators]
```

1. **Task Planner**: High-level goal management
2. **Motion Planner**: Path planning and obstacle avoidance
3. **Whole-Body Controller**: Balance and coordination
4. **Joint Controllers**: Individual joint control
