# Hardware Guide: Platforms, Components, and Development Setup

## Overview of Humanoid Robotics Hardware

Humanoid robotics development requires careful consideration of hardware platforms, from simulation-focused systems to full-scale physical robots. This guide covers the spectrum of hardware options available for different needs and budgets, from entry-level development to research-grade platforms.

## Hardware Categories

### Entry-Level Development
