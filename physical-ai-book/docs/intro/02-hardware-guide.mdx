| **Total** | **$9,000** | **$39,000** | **$155,000** |

### Cost Optimization Strategies

1. **Start Small**: Begin with single-leg or biped prototypes
2. **Use Simulation**: Maximize time in simulation before hardware purchase
3. **Modular Design**: Build systems in modular components
4. **Buy Used**: Research-grade equipment often available second-hand
5. **Academic Discounts**: Leverage educational pricing for software/hardware
6. **Collaboration**: Share costs with other researchers/teams

## Recommended Starter Kit

Based on the above considerations, here's our recommended starter configuration for beginners:

### Development Setup
- **Workstation**: RTX 4070Ti, i7-13700K, 32GB RAM (or equivalent AMD)
- **Software**: Isaac Sim, ROS2 Humble, Isaac ROS packages
- **Cloud Access**: Qdrant Cloud, Google Cloud (for AI APIs)

### Simulation Focus (No Immediate Hardware)
- Focus on developing skills in:
  - Isaac Sim for physics simulation
  - ROS2 for robotics programming
  - Reinforcement learning for control
  - Computer vision for perception
  - Motion planning for navigation

### Hardware Acquisition Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Start with simulation mastery
2. **Phase 2**: Acquire small robotic platform (e.g., TurtleBot3, LoCoBot)
3. **Phase 3**: Progress to more complex hardware as needed

This approach allows you to develop sophisticated humanoid robotics skills while managing costs effectively. The simulation skills you develop will transfer directly to real hardware when you're ready to make the investment.

## Troubleshooting Common Hardware Issues

### GPU Memory Problems
- **Issue**: Out of memory during simulation
- **Solution**: Reduce physics complexity, lower rendering quality, or upgrade GPU

### Real-time Performance
- **Issue**: Simulation running slower than real-time
- **Solution**: Reduce physics update rate, optimize collision meshes, add more RAM

### Perception Pipeline Issues
- **Issue**: Slow inference on Jetson
- **Solution**: Optimize models for edge deployment, use TensorRT optimization

The most important thing to remember is that humanoid robotics is an interdisciplinary field requiring expertise across multiple domains. Start with simulation to build foundational knowledge, then gradually incorporate hardware as your understanding deepens.
